 Updated the plan file at ~/.claude/plans/fuzzy-honking-stroustrup.md.

  Done:
  - Directory structure (data/, notebooks/, src/, models/, reports/)
  - requirements.txt
  - 3 notebooks: data acquisition, cleaning, feature engineering

  Remaining:
  - 04_eda.ipynb - visualizations and correlation analysis
  - 05_modeling.ipynb - train Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting
  - src/api/risk_scorer.py - production API returning risk scores

  To resume, just say "continue" and I'll pick up where we left off.

     # Credit Risk Modeling - Implementation Status
     
     ## Completed
     
     ### Project Setup
     - [x] Created directory structure: `data/`, `notebooks/`, `src/`, `models/`,
     `reports/`
     - [x] Created `requirements.txt` with all dependencies
     - [x] Created `src/__init__.py` and `src/api/__init__.py`
     
     ### Notebooks Created
     - [x] `notebooks/01_data_acquisition.ipynb` - Download LendingClub data via
     kagglehub
     - [x] `notebooks/02_data_cleaning.ipynb` - Handle missing values, create target,
      remove leakage
     - [x] `notebooks/03_feature_engineering.ipynb` - Create ratios, encode
     categoricals
     
     ## Remaining
     
     ### Notebooks to Create
     - [ ] `notebooks/04_eda.ipynb` - Exploratory Data Analysis
       - Target distribution visualization
       - Interest rate vs default analysis
       - Income distribution by default status
       - Correlation heatmap
       - Default rate by grade, home ownership, purpose
     
     - [ ] `notebooks/05_modeling.ipynb` - Model Training
       - 80/20 train-test split (stratified)
       - StandardScaler preprocessing
       - Baseline: Logistic Regression (`class_weight='balanced'`)
       - Advanced: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting
       - Evaluation: ROC-AUC, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report
       - Save best model with joblib
     
     - [ ] `notebooks/06_model_comparison.ipynb` (optional)
       - Cross-validation comparison
       - Threshold optimization
     
     ### Production API
     - [ ] `src/api/risk_scorer.py` - CreditRiskScorer class
       - `predict(borrower_profile)` method
       - Returns: risk_score (0-100), decision (APPROVE/MANUAL_REVIEW/REJECT),
     probability
       - Thresholds: ≤30 Approve, 30-60 Review, >60 Reject
